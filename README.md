# Algorithms-and-Data-structure
Here is all my work related to problem solving, implementations of different algorithms and data structures from scratch in C++.\
I've finished 3 courses of 'Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization' offered by university of california san diego:
1. Algorithmic Toolbox
2. Data Structures
3. Algorithms on Graphs/
**I participated at ICPC 2020 and my team got 9th place among Faculty of Engineering ASU participants**
